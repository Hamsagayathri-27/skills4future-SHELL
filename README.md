# skills4future-SHELL
üí° Internship projects completed during the Shell Skills4Future Program. This repo includes data analysis, Python, and visualization projects such as Renewable Energy Dataset Analysis and more.

## üåç Renewable Energy Dataset Analysis

This project is part of the Shell Skills4Future Internship. It involves analyzing renewable energy consumption data across multiple countries and years using Python and Pandas.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tools & Libraries Used

Python

Pandas

Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

Jupyter Notebook

## üöÄ Steps Performed

Imported and cleaned the dataset (renewable_energy.csv).

Explored dataset structure (shape, columns, missing values).

Analyzed renewable energy supply trends by country and year.

Visualized renewable energy growth patterns globally and regionally.

## üìä Dataset Description  

This dataset contains **renewable energy statistics** with 8 columns and 15,904 rows.  

| Column Name   | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| **LOCATION**  | Country or region code (e.g., AUS for Australia, OECD for Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development). |
| **INDICATOR** | Type of indicator measured (e.g., RENEWABLE). |
| **SUBJECT**   | Sub-category or type of renewable energy (e.g., TOT = Total). |
| **MEASURE**   | Unit of measurement (e.g., KTOE = Kilotonne of Oil Equivalent, PC_PRYENRGSUPPLY = Percentage of Primary Energy Supply). |
| **FREQUENCY** | Data frequency (e.g., A = Annual). |
| **TIME**      | Year of the record (e.g., 1960, 2015). |
| **Value**     | Numerical value of renewable energy consumption/production in the given unit. |
| **Flag Codes**| Special notes or flags for data quality/availability (NaN if not applicable). |
