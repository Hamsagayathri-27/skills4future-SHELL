## üìä Dataset

Dataset link ‚Üí https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ayushchandramaurya/renewable-energy

This dataset contains renewable energy statistics with 8 columns and ~16,000 rows.

Column Descriptions:
- LOCATION: Country/region code (e.g., AUS, OECD)
- INDICATOR: Type of indicator (e.g., RENEWABLE)
- SUBJECT: Sub-category/type of renewable energy (TOT = Total)
- MEASURE: Unit (KTOE, % of primary energy supply)
- FREQUENCY: Data frequency (A = Annual)
- TIME: Year of record (1960‚Äì2015)
- Value: Numerical value of renewable energy consumption/production
- Flag Codes: Notes/flags (NaN if not applicable)

LOCATION | INDICATOR | SUBJECT | MEASURE | FREQUENCY | TIME | Value | Flag Codes
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---
AUS | RENEWABLE | TOT | KTOE | A | 1960 | 4436.932 | NaN
AUS | RENEWABLE | TOT | KTOE | A | 1961 | 4490.510 | NaN
OECD | RENEWABLE | TOT | PC_PRYENRGSUPPLY | A | 2015 | 9.640 | NaN

# üìå Project Work

## ‚úÖ Week 1 ‚Äì Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
- Imported and cleaned dataset.
- Explored dataset structure (shape, columns, missing values).
- Analyzed renewable energy supply trends by country and year.
- Visualized growth patterns globally and regionally.
- Compared adoption among countries (India, USA, China).
- Identified top years of renewable energy usage for selected countries.
---

## ‚úÖ Week 2 ‚Äì Machine Learning Model Implementation
- Preprocessed dataset (handled NaN, selected features: LOCATION, TIME, Value).
- Applied Linear Regression to predict renewable energy usage.
- Trained/Tested the model using train_test_split.
- Evaluated performance with MAE and R¬≤ Score.
- Visualized predictions vs actual values for India, USA, China, Australia.

ML Output Example:
- Model trained on renewable energy data of India.
- Predicted growth trend for upcoming years.
- Accuracy (R¬≤ Score): ~0.92

Insight: Forecasts renewable energy adoption to assist policymakers.

## ‚úÖ Week 3 ‚Äì ML Deployment & Predictions
- Implemented deployment workflow for the trained ML model using joblib.

Steps Performed:
1. Dataset Loading & Preprocessing
   - Dropped unnecessary columns and handled missing target values.
   - One-hot encoded categorical columns (e.g., LOCATION).
   - Standardized numeric features with StandardScaler.
2. Model Training
   - Trained a Random Forest Regressor (200 trees, max depth 10).
   - Evaluated with MSE and R¬≤ Score.
   - Determined feature importance.
3. Model Saving
   - Saved model and scaler using joblib: renewable_energy_model.pkl & renewable_energy_scaler.pkl
4. Flexible Prediction Workflow
   - Batch prediction from CSV ‚Üí outputs predicted_results.csv
   - Manual input mode ‚Üí dynamically enter any feature values
   - Predictions scaled, computed, and displayed automatically
5. Visualization of Predictions
   - Plotted predicted values for batch CSV or manual input

Manual Input Example:
Enter values for features to predict:
LOCATION_OECD: 0
TIME: 2015
...
Prediction Completed:
LOCATION_OECD  TIME  Predicted_Value
0 0 2015 5980.23

Feature Importance Example:
Feature | Importance
---|---
TIME | 0.42
LOCATION_OECD | 0.30
... | ...
